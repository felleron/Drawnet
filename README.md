# Neural Network Visualization with SDL

This project implements a neural network visualization using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) in C. It allows you to dynamically adjust the architecture of the neural network and visualize the changes in real-time.

## Features

- Dynamically adjust the architecture of the neural network
- Visualize the neural network architecture using SDL graphics
- User-friendly interface for modifying the network architecture

## Dependencies

- SDL2 library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
3. Run the executable.
4. Press Esc to exit the program.
